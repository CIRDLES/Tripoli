## Tripoli Project Progress Update Announcement!

We have a poster at the upcoming Gordon Research Conference in Geochronology at Mt. Snow, VT, August 13-18.  If you’re attending, please catch up with Noah McLean for a first look at our last year of progress and help add to and prioritize our list of new functionality to develop in the next two years.  We have created a series of visualizations and data reduction templates for mixed-collector TIMS measurements that we’ll extend to MC-ICPMS and simpler TIMS methods.  After the conference, you can access the poster (eventually here), and find our development repository with the latest version of the software [Tripoli](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli).
