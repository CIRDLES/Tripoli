## Tripoli Project Progress Update Announcement!

We have a poster at the upcoming AGU annual conference in San Francisco.  If you’re attending, please catch up with Scott Burdick for a look at our last year of progress and help add to and prioritize our list of new functionality to develop in the next two years.  We have created a series of visualizations and data reduction templates for mixed-collector TIMS measurements that we’ll extend to MC-ICPMS and simpler TIMS methods.  You can access the [poster](http://cirdles.org/Tripoli/assets/publications/Burdick_Tripoli_AGU2023.pdf), and find our development repository with the latest version of the software [Tripoli](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli).
