#### Announcement and Call to Participate

PIs Noah McLean, Scott Burdick, and Jim Bowring (see [About](/Tripoli/about.html)) have received a three-year NSF
grant (see [Abstract](/Tripoli/nsf_award_abstract.html)) to develop a new version of the software product Tripoli.

##### Tripoli Description

Tripoli imports raw mass spectrometer data files and supports interactive review and archiving of isotopic data. Tripoli
facilitates visualization of temporal trends and scatter during measurement, statistically rigorous filtering of data,
and calculation of statistical parameters.

##### Mission

Our mission is to develop the Tripoli software product collaboratively with the user community. One important goal is to
create a culture and practice of sustainability to ensure a long life-span for Tripoli.

##### History

The original [Tripoli](https://github.com/bowring/tripoli) dates from 2002 and is in wide use and is maintained.

##### Development Plan

We are implementing an agile development process to support collaboration:

1) We are hosting Tripoli development on GitHub at https://github.com/cirdles/Tripoli as an open source repository. This
   repository will house all artifacts including meeting agendas and minutes, requirements documents for functionality,
   data formats, tests, and UX design. It will contain the content of this website
   http://cirdles.org/Tripoli in the ["docs"](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/tree/main/docs) folder. The repository
   has additional support for [projects](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/projects),
   [discussions](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/discussions), and a
   [Wiki](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/wiki). In order to participate on GitHub, users will need to create a free
   account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

2) We will maintain a [website](http://cirdles.org/Tripoli) that provides timely updates and tutorials as we develop
   them. If you are reluctant to get a GitHub acount, this site is for you.

3) We will host regularly scheduled Zoom meetings for collaboration among community members.

4) Agile development is iterative and driven by use cases and requests provided by the community. If you join GitHub,
   you will be able to start and join [discussions](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/discussions). Here you can
   propose needed functionality or discuss current progress, etc.

5) Agile development is test-driven. This simply means that we should be able to think of a way to test any
   functionality that we want Tripoli to implement. So, in addition to describing the functionality, we write some test
   cases in natural language that provide both the inputs and the expected outcomes for each test.

6) We intend to follow the open source practice of "release early and often."

7) Community members can contribute in many ways:

    - Join GitHub and participate in [discussions](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/discussions).

    - Attend and contribute to team Zoom meetings.

    - Download releases and provide evaluations and suggestions via
      [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/issues).

    - Contribute actual or synthetic data for testing.

    - Contribute to and maintain the [Wiki](https://github.com/CIRDLES/Tripoli/wiki)
      and / or [website](http://cirdles.org/Tripoli/).

    - Contribute tutorials about your related expertise and / or about using Tripoli as it matures.

    - Become and / or recruit people to inherit key roles in the development process.

    - Take a leading role in establishing our industrial-academic oversight board that is envisioned as a vehicle to
      establish sustainability and maintenance plans for the Tripoli product.
