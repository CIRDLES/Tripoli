#### Announcement and Call to Participate
PIs Noah McLean, Scott Burdick, and Jim Bowring (see [About](/about.html)) have received a three-year 
NSF grant (see [Abstract](/nsf_award_abstract.html)) to develop a new version of the software product Tripoli.

##### Tripoli Description
Tripoli imports raw mass spectrometer data files and supports interactive review and archiving of isotopic data. Tripoli facilitates visualization of temporal trends and scatter during measurement, statistically rigorous filtering of data, and calculation of statistical parameters.

##### Mission
Our mission is to develop the Tripoli software product collaboratively with the user community. One important
goal is to create a culture and practice of sustainability to ensure a long life-span for Tripoli.

##### History
The original [Tripoli](https://github.com/bowring/tripoli) dates from 2002 and is in wide use and is maintained.
